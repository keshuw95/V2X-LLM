# V2X-LLM: Enhancing V2X Integration and Understanding in Connected Vehicle Corridors

## Overview

**V2X-LLM** is a framework that leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to improve real-time **integration, analysis, and reasoning** of **Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) data**. It enhances the understanding of connected vehicle corridors, offering intelligent decision support for traffic management.

## Architecture

The V2X-LLM framework processes **V2X messages** and **CV corridor data**, encodes scenarios, and generates task-specific prompts for LLM-based reasoning.

## Features

V2X-LLM enhances **V2X integration and understanding** by performing the following key tasks:

- **Scenario Explanation** â€“ Generates narratives for complex traffic conditions.
- **V2X Data Description** â€“ Provides structured insights into vehicle and infrastructure statuses.
- **State Prediction** â€“ Forecasts future traffic states based on real-time V2X data.
- **Navigation Advisory** â€“ Offers optimized routing guidance for enhanced mobility.
